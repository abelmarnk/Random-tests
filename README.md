## Overview
This repository contains different things that come to mind to try out, mostly from things which i don't understand the behaviour completely.

## Building
The structure of the repository is simple, the programs instructions are in programs/src/instructions and the tests are in programs/tests/test.rs

The program can be build by running `anchor build` and the tests can then be run, by running `cargo test` .
